# Homepage Design Specification
## Infrastructure for Informal Private Investments

---

## 1. HERO SECTION

### Headline
**Private investment infrastructure for founders and their trusted network**

### Subheadline
Generate agreements, track obligations, and automate reporting—without the spreadsheets, PDFs, and awkward emails that break down over time.

### Primary CTA
**Request Access**

### Secondary CTA
**See How It Works**

### Visual Notes
- Headline: 48-56px, medium weight, dark gray (#1a1a1a)
- Subheadline: 20-24px, regular weight, medium gray (#4a4a4a)
- Primary CTA: Prominent button, dark background (#1a1a1a), white text
- Secondary CTA: Outlined button, same dark border, transparent background
- Generous white space around elements
- Optional: Subtle geometric pattern or grid in background (very light, 5% opacity)

## 2. PROBLEM SECTION

### Headline
**The tools you're using weren't built for this**

### Body Copy
Most founders raising from friends and family start with what's available: a Word doc, a spreadsheet, WhatsApp messages. It works—until it doesn't.

Six months later, you're tracking who committed what, when payments are due, and what you've already sent. Investors ask for updates, and you're scrambling to pull numbers. A payment is missed, and suddenly there's confusion about terms. Trust erodes over administrative friction.

This isn't a problem with your investors or your business. It's a problem with the tools.

### Visual Notes
- Two-column layout: text on left, simple illustration or icon on right
- Illustration: Abstract representation of fragmented tools (documents, spreadsheets, messages)
- Use muted colors: grays and a single accent color (if any)
- No dramatic imagery or fear-based visuals

---

## 3. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

### Headline
**Built for the reality of informal investing**

### Pillar Cards (3-4 cards in a grid)

#### Card 1: Standardized Agreements
**Generate investment documents**
SAFE, convertible notes, and revenue share agreements—standardized, filled with your terms, ready to sign. No legal advice, just the templates you need.

#### Card 2: Obligation Tracking
**Know who's owed what, when**
Every commitment, payment, and milestone in one place. See upcoming obligations at a glance, and never miss a payment or reporting deadline.

#### Card 3: Automated Reporting
**Keep investors informed, automatically**
Generate and send investor updates on schedule—without drafting emails or pulling numbers manually. They see what they need, when they need it.

#### Card 4: Cash Flow Visibility
**See investor obligations in context**
Your investor commitments aren't separate from your cash flow. View obligations alongside your financials to understand timing and plan ahead.

### Visual Notes
- Grid layout: 2x2 on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Each card: Icon (line art, minimal), headline, 2-3 sentence description
- Cards: Light background (#f8f8f8), subtle border, hover state with slight elevation
- Icons: Monochrome or single accent color, simple geometric shapes

## 4. HOW IT WORKS

### Headline
**Simple, controlled, transparent**

### Step Flow (3 steps, horizontal or vertical)

#### Step 1: Create and Generate
Set up an investment round, enter your terms, and generate a standardized agreement. Review everything before sending—you control every step.

#### Step 2: Track Over Time
As contributions come in and obligations accrue, the system tracks everything automatically. You see the full picture: who's paid, what's pending, what's due.

#### Step 3: Automated Updates
Investors receive regular updates via email or portal access. No manual reports, no forgotten communications. They stay informed; you stay focused.

### Visual Notes
- Numbered steps (1, 2, 3) with connecting line or arrow
- Each step: Number badge, headline, 1-2 sentence description
- Optional: Small thumbnail or wireframe of relevant screen per step
- Keep it minimal—no complex diagrams

## 6. TRUST & GUARDRAILS

### Headline
**Built with guardrails, not promises**

### Body Copy
This is infrastructure, not advice. Here's what we do and don't do:

### Bullet Points
- **We don't custody funds.** Money flows directly between you and your investors. We never touch it.
- **We don't give legal or investment advice.** We provide templates and tools. You and your advisors make the decisions.
- **Every action requires your approval.** Document generation, report sending, access grants—nothing happens automatically without your review.
- **Clear audit trails.** Every action is logged. You can see who did what, when, and why.
- **Compliance-aware by design.** We're built to help you stay organized and transparent, not to skirt regulations.

### Visual Notes
- Simple list format, no icons needed (or very minimal checkmarks)
- Use a light background color (#fafafa) to distinguish this section
- Keep bullets concise and factual
- No warning symbols or red text—calm, informative tone

---

## 7. WHO IT'S FOR / WHO IT'S NOT

### Headline
**Built for specific use cases**

### Two-Column Layout

#### Left Column: Who It's For
**Founder-led businesses**
- Raising $5k–$250k from friends, family, and small angels
- Pre-VC startups building their first investor relationships
- Immigrant and family-funded businesses
- Operators who need structure without institutional overhead

**Small angels**
- Individuals making informal investments
- Friends and family who want clarity and updates
- Angels who invest outside formal funds

#### Right Column: Who It's Not For
**Not for retail investors**
- We don't solicit investments or facilitate public offerings
- Not a crowdfunding platform

**Not for institutions**
- VC funds have their own tools and processes
- Hedge funds and large institutions need different infrastructure
- We're focused on the informal, relationship-based investing space

### Visual Notes
- Clear visual separation between columns (border or background difference)
- Use checkmarks for "For" and X marks or "Not for" labels for exclusions
- Keep language direct and factual
- No judgment—just clear boundaries

---

## 8. SOCIAL PROOF / CREDIBILITY

### Headline
**Built by founders, for founders**

### Body Copy
We built this because we've been there. Raising from friends and family means managing relationships, not just money. The tools should support that, not complicate it.

### Optional Elements (Placeholders)
- **Early users:** "Used by [X] founders raising informal rounds"
- **Advisors:** "Built with guidance from [legal/finance advisors]" (only if real)
- **Founder story:** Brief 1-2 sentence personal note (if authentic)

### Visual Notes
- Keep it minimal and authentic
- No fake logos or testimonials
- If including numbers, be specific and honest (e.g., "Used by 12 founders" not "Used by thousands")
- Optional: Simple headshot or founder signature if personal story is included
- Light, understated design

---

## 9. FINAL CTA

### Headline
**Ready to get started?**

### Body Copy
Request access to join the waitlist. We're rolling out access gradually to ensure we can support each founder properly.

### Primary CTA
**Request Access**

### Reassurance Line (below CTA)
No credit card required. We'll be in touch within 48 hours.

### Visual Notes
- Center-aligned section
- Generous white space
- Primary CTA button: Same style as hero section
- Reassurance line: Smaller text, lighter gray (#6a6a6a)
- Optional: Simple email input field if collecting emails directly (but "Request Access" button is primary)

---

- **Secondary text:** #4a4a4a (medium gray)
- **Tertiary text:** #6a6a6a (light gray)
- **Background:** #ffffff (white)
- **Light backgrounds:** #f8f8f8, #fafafa (for section differentiation)
- **Accent color (if used):** Single, muted color (e.g., #2563eb for blue, or #059669 for green)—use sparingly
- **Borders:** #e5e5e5 (very light gray)

### Typography
- **Headlines:** 36-56px, medium weight (500-600), system font stack or clean sans-serif

### Spacing
- **Section padding:** 80-120px vertical on desktop, 60-80px on mobile

- **Content width:** 600-700px for body text blocks

### Visual Style

### Language & Tone
- **Direct and clear:** No marketing fluff

- **Calm confidence:** Professional but approachable
- **No buzzwords:** Avoid "disrupt," "revolutionary," "game-changing," "AI-powered" (unless necessary)

### Layout Hierarchy
1. **Hero:** Largest visual impact, clear CTAs

### Mobile Considerations
- Stack all columns on mobile
- Reduce font sizes proportionally
- Maintain generous spacing
- Ensure CTAs are thumb-friendly (44px minimum height)

### Future Iterations
- Add real testimonials when available (with permission)
